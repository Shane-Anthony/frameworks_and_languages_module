Server Framework Features
-------------------------

### **Routing**

Routing is the method used to map the URL Path to either a function or some logic. When a request has been received, the server then matches the request to its specified route and sends the correct response back.

```
const express = require('express')
const app = express()

// respond with "Hello world!! This is Express!" when a GET request is made to the homepage
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello world!! This is Express!')
}) 
```

Express.js provides a convenient and minimalistic routing feature that requires little code to implement as opposed to other frameworks such as Django. This is ideal so that the server code is easier to maintain because the routing and logic can be kept in one file which is suitable for smaller applications such as this one.

Critique of Server/Client prototype
---------------------

### Rendering - Client

```javascript
function render_items(params) {
		fetch(`${urlAPI}/items?${new URLSearchParams(params).toString()}`)
			.then(response => response.json())
			.then(renderItems)
		.catch(err => console.error(err));
	}
```

### CORS 

```python
RESPONSE_DEFAULTS = {
    'code': 200, 
    'body': '',
    'Content-type': 'text/html; charset=utf-8',
    'Server': 'CustomHTTP/0.0 Python/3.9.0+',
    'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*',
